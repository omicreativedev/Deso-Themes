# Compatability

Themes in /Bitclout are currently compatible with version 1.0.4 of Bitclout.com frontend as of July 9, 2021. If [PR #107](https://github.com/bitclout/frontend/pull/107) is merged and deployed, themes will be updated after main node deployment of that feature and old themes will be moved to an archive.

# Other Nodes/ Frontends

If you have an Open Source Bitclout node or frontend that is themeable (even with additional features), feel free to reach out to [@BrixBoston100](https://bitclout.com/u/BrixBoston100) with the repo of your project and I'll explore porting themes for your project here so others can grab them for their forks.

# Contributing

If you have a contribution, please look through the repository to learn the best places for things then fork, branch, and pull. Frontend tweaks and themes only. Please OVER-document everything.
